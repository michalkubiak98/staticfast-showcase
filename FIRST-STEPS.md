# üöÄ StaticFast - Complete Guide to Your Professional Website

**Welcome!** This guide will take you from zero to a live professional website. We'll be thorough and detailed so you understand each step and avoid problems.

## üìã What You'll Get

- ‚úÖ **Professional responsive website** (mobile-friendly)
- ‚úÖ **Lightning-fast loading** (hosted on AWS CloudFront CDN)
- ‚úÖ **Your own domain** (like yourcompany.com)
- ‚úÖ **SSL certificate** (secure HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic deployments** (updates go live instantly)
- ‚úÖ **Cost-effective** (~$2-3/month total)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read This First

**This guide assumes you have basic command line knowledge.** You'll need to:
- Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
- Navigate to directories with `cd`

## üåê PHASE 1: Deploy Your Website

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

**Important:** Claude Code works in your current directory. Navigate to where you have the StaticFast boilerplate:

```bash
cd /path/to/staticfast-boilerplate
```

### Step 2: Start Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

This opens an interactive session with Claude Code.

### Step 3: Use This Detailed Prompt

**Copy and paste this EXACTLY, but replace the bracketed values with your information:**

```
I want to create a professional business website using this StaticFast boilerplate. I need you to guide me through each step carefully and ask for my approval before running any commands I might not understand.

Here's what I want you to help me do:

1. First, ask me detailed questions about my business and website design preferences:
   - Show me examples of color schemes and ask what I prefer
   - Ask about my business type and target audience
   - Help me choose appropriate content and imagery
   - Ask about layout preferences and any specific features I need

2. Copy this boilerplate to a new directory called "my-website"

3. Configure the .env file with my business details (I'll provide them)

4. Help me test the website locally with npm run dev so I can see how it looks

5. Only after I'm satisfied with the local version, deploy the infrastructure to AWS

6. Build and upload the website to S3

7. Set up a GitHub repository with automatic deployments

8. Add all environment variables as GitHub Secrets

IMPORTANT: 
- Ask me to approve each command before you run it
- Explain what each step does and why it's necessary
- Stop and let me review the website locally before deploying to AWS
- Walk me through any errors if they occur

My basic details to start with:
- Business Name: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME]
- Business Type: [e.g., Restaurant, Consulting, Retail, etc.]
- Target Audience: [Who are your customers?]
- Phone: [YOUR PHONE]
- Email: [YOUR EMAIL]
- Address: [YOUR ADDRESS OR CITY/STATE]

AWS details:
- Account ID: [YOUR 12-DIGIT AWS ACCOUNT ID]
- Region: us-east-1
- Project name: [unique-project-name-no-spaces]

GitHub username: [YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]

Please start by asking me questions about my business and design preferences, and show me some examples to choose from.
```

### What Happens Next

Claude Code will:

1. **Ask you detailed questions** about your business, design preferences, colors, content, etc.
2. **Show you examples** and help you make design decisions
3. **Create your project** in a new directory
4. **Set up the environment** with your business details
5. **Start the local development server** so you can see your website
6. **Ask for your approval** before each major step
7. **Deploy to AWS** only after you're happy with the local version
8. **Set up GitHub** for automatic deployments

### IMPORTANT: You Must Approve Commands

Claude Code will show you commands like:
```bash
npm install
aws cdk deploy
gh repo create
```

**You need to approve these!** Claude Code will explain:
- What each command does
- Why it's necessary
- What to expect

If you don't understand something, ask Claude Code to explain further.

## üåç PHASE 2: Custom Domain Setup

### Option A: Buy Domain Through AWS Route53

**After your website is live, use this prompt:**

```
My website is working on the CloudFront URL. Now I want to add a custom domain. Please help me:

1. Search for available domains in Route53 that match my business
2. Show me pricing for different domain extensions (.com, .org, .net, etc.)
3. Help me purchase the domain I choose
4. Update my CDK infrastructure to use the custom domain
5. Deploy the changes and verify everything works

I want to search for domains related to: [your business name/keywords]
```

**Manual Steps (if you prefer):**
1. Go to [AWS Route53 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/)
2. Click "Register Domain"
3. Search for your desired domain
4. Complete purchase (~$12/year for .com)
5. Domain will be ready in 5-15 minutes

### Option B: Use Existing Domain (Manual Setup)

If you already own a domain from GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.:

**What you'll need from your current registrar:**
- Domain authorization code (EPP code)
- Unlock domain for transfer
- Disable privacy protection temporarily

**Transfer process:**
1. Get authorization code from your current registrar
2. Unlock domain in your registrar's control panel
3. Use Claude Code to help transfer to Route53

**OR keep domain at current registrar and just update DNS:**
1. Get the CloudFront distribution URL from AWS
2. Update DNS records at your current registrar:
   - Create CNAME record: `www` ‚Üí `your-cloudfront-url`
   - Create A record redirect: `@` ‚Üí `www.yourdomain.com`

## üßπ Cleanup (Remove Everything)

### When You Want to Remove Everything

**Navigate to your project directory:**
```bash
cd my-website  # your project directory
```

```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

**What happens:**
1. Script asks for confirmation (type 'yes')
2. Deletes S3 bucket and all files
3. Removes CloudFront distribution
4. Deletes SSL certificates
5. Removes Route53 records
6. Cleans up CDK stack

**Cost after cleanup: $0** ‚úÖ

**Domain note:** Your domain registration is separate - it won't be deleted. You can:
- Keep the domain for future use
- Transfer it elsewhere
- Let it expire (you'll get renewal notices)
